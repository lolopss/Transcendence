## How does it works

Firstly when you have all the requirements needed, you will have to run the project by writing **make** or **make re** in the prompt.
This will use the ```docker-compose -build``` and ```docker-compose -up``` commands to build the docker images and run them.
When this is complete you can access our ***PONG*** website with this url : https://localhost:8000

To check the containers status and the current images on your device, you can use the command ```make check```,
